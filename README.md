# Groupomania - Open Classrooms's School Project

Final project before graduate, this is about a social network of Groupomania enterprise. *( MVP version )*

# Rules

JavaScript must be use, front-end side we have to choose a framework & back-end side we have to use SQL Databases.

# Front side

I choosed the library `React`, and `Tailwind CSS` for all style part of the project.

To handle React states, i choosed `Recoil JS`. For the API request i use `axios`. And for the security routes i choose `React Router`.

# Back side

We choose `Node JS` and the framework `Express`, i don't use any ORM to communicate with database `SQL`
